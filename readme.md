### Operating System

Well, a running program does one very simple thing: it executes instructions.
Many millions (and these days, even billions) of times every second, the
processor fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it (i.e., figures
out which instruction this is), and executes it (i.e., it does
the thing that it is supposed to do, like add two numbers together, access
memory, check a condition, jump to a function, and so forth). After it is
done with this instruction, the processor moves on to the next instruction,
and so on, and so on, until the program finally completes

Sounds simple, right? But in this class, we will be learning
that while a program runs, a lot of other wild things are going on with
the primary goal of making the system easy to use.

Operating System is a program that manages a computerâ€™s resources,
especially the allocation of those resources among other programs.
Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer
memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections
